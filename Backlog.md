## Not implemented yet (from recent requests)
- [ ] Custom deck creation UI that lets you enter kanji compounds, splits them into kanji, fetches details/examples/compounds, and creates a deck of those items.
- [ ] Manual kanji/vocab entry workflow for user-provided decks (with compound parsing and card creation).
- [ ] Review scoping to custom decks (beyond JLPT/Grade selectors).
